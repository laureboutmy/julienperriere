                  And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced. So let there be no doubt: the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. It is time for these settlements to stop.

                  And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States. Given my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough. I can assure you it is not. Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. America, we cannot turn back. We did not go by choice, we went because of necessity.

                  They're telling me that their conversation about what it means to be Catholic continues. But it is where we start. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war. That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century.

                  And I've found that no matter where I am, or who I'm talking to, there's a common theme that emerges. They want a sense of purpose, a narrative arc to their lives. It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity one day and affirm my Christian faith. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.

                  They know they have to work hard to get ahead - and they want to. His values - and his record - affirm what is best in us. That is one option.

                  Thank you. And may God's peace be upon you.
